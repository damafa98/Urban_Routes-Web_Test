# Daniela-Malagon - Sprint-3

The project consisted of designing, executing, and documenting quality tests for a car booking application, following a structured approach and using checklists, test cases, and bug reports in Jira.

## 1. Booking Form Design Checklist:
-A checklist focused on the "Luxury" travel scenario was created.
-Aspects of spelling, element layout, visual appearance, and navigation were validated.
-Critical pop-up windows were included: Car Booked, Are You Sure You Want to Cancel the Trip?, and Trip Canceled.
-The list was documented in the "1. Design Checklist" tab of the spreadsheet.

## 2. Payment Functionality Checklist
-A checklist was created for the "Payment Method" and "Add Card" windows, using equivalence class partitioning and boundary value analysis techniques.
-Positive and negative tests were designed to cover various data entry scenarios.
-This was documented in the “2. Payment Method and Add Card Checklist” tab.

##3. Test Cases for the “Book” Button
-Positive and negative test cases were defined based on the button requirements.
-The display of trip distance and duration on the button was validated, without the need to check internal calculations.
-The cases were documented in the “3. Test Cases for the Book Button” tab.

##4. Test Cases for the Car Rental Function
-Positive and negative test cases were prepared according to the rental functionality requirements.
-The cases were recorded in the “4. Test Cases for Rental” tab.

##5. Test Execution and Error Reporting
-The application was tested in two environment configurations:
    -Google Chrome, 800x600
    -Firefox, 1920x1080
-Design testing was performed in both environments; The functional logic was validated in a single test.
-Each test was marked as PASS or FAIL.
-For cases with a FAIL result, bug reports were logged in Jira and linked in the corresponding column of the spreadsheet.

##Project outcome:
The exercise simulated a complete QA workflow: designing checklists, creating test cases, executing them in different environments, and managing defects in Jira. It also reinforced the practice of analysis techniques such as equivalence class partitioning and boundary values, as well as collaboration in multi-tool environments.
